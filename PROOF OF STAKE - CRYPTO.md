PROOF OF STAKE - CRYPTO

Proof-of-stake cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions
and creating new block in blockchain. 
A consensus mechanism is a method for validaing entries into a distributed database
and keeping the data base secure.
In case of cryptocurrency, the database is called blockchain - so the consensus
mechanism secure blockchain.


1. Under Proof-of-Stake, validators are chosen based on the number of staked coins they have.
2. Proof-of-stake was created as an alternative to proof-of-work, the original
consensus mechanism used to validate transactions and open new blocks.
3. POS is seen less risky regarding the portential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation in a way thaat makes an attack less advantageous.
4. Whil PoW mechanism require minner to solve cryptographic puzzle, PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens for the privilege of earning transaction fees.
5. The next block writer on the blockchain is selected at random, with higher odds being assigned to nodes with larger stake positions.
